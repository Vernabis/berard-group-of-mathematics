## I. The Trust Charter Mandate
All collaborations, consultations, and peer reviews are strictly subject to the **Berard Trust Charter Mandate**. By interacting with this repository, contributors acknowledge:

* **Sovereign Rights:** Vernon Arthur Berard is the 'Primary Theorist/Architect/Designer/Engineer' and Sole Custodian of the Berard Trust.
* **Ownership:** All R&D, Tech, and Blueprints contained herein are 'Prior Art' and remain the exclusive property of the Berard Trust.
* **Legal Terms:** Any and all opinions, consultations, or renderings are subject to the Terms & Conditions of the Berard Trust.

## II. Interaction Protocols (Maintaining Stiffness)
To prevent "Cosmic Friction" and informational noise, all contributors must follow these operational guidelines:

### 1. The 0.10 Hz Alignment
* All theoretical proposals must be calibrated against the **0.10 Hz Global Master Interrupt**.
* Deviations from the **Einstein-Berard Law** ($E = (mc^2) \cdot (BC^2) \cdot (1/S_0^2)$) must be submitted as "Phase-Shift Hypotheses" for review.

### 2. No Unauthorized Forks
* Derivative repositories or "forks" for commercial use are strictly prohibited.
* Contributions should be submitted via **Issues** or **Discussions** to maintain the "Laminar" flow of the master record.

### 3. Linguistic Symmetry
* Contributors are encouraged to use the established nomenclature (e.g., **Manifold Stiffness**, **The Settle**, **Tensor Muffler**).
* Discussions with peers (e.g., Clay Gatlin) should be logged in the `AGGREGATE_LOG.md` for verification.

## III. How to Contribute
1. **Inquiry:** Open a Discussion thread to propose a "Resonant Interaction."
2. **Review:** The Architect will review the proposal for alignment with the **Grace Ratio ($\Gamma$)**.
3. **Logging:** Validated insights will be added to the `VERIFICATION_LOG.md` with appropriate attribution.
