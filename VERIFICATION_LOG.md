## II. Collaborative Technical Verification
**Correspondent:** Clay Gatlin (@CLAYGATLIN)

### 1. Linguistic Symmetry
* **Verification Point:** Resolved the framework overlap as "two languages" rather than a "deliberate fork".
* **Result:** Maintained the symmetry of coordinal observation and early universe potential.

### 2. Frequency Calibration
* **Technical Log:** Discussion regarding the 0.10 Hz Global Master Interrupt ("The Hum") and its presence in timing arrays.
* **Status:** Active verification of the 0.10 Hz anchor against pulsar/CMB timing data.
