## Overview
This repository contains the formal mathematical engine of the **Berard Group**, a Dilation Symmetry Group governing the **Unified Theory of Informational Rigidity**. This framework extends the **Einstein-Berard Law** to define the physical regulators of the vacuum through Manifold Stiffness ($S_0$) and the 0.10 Hz Global Master Interrupt.

## I. The Core Axioms: The Einstein-Berard Law
The fundamental extension of mass-energy equivalence:

$$E = (mc^2) \cdot (BC^2) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{S_0^2}\right)$$

* **$B$ (The Berard Constant):** 0.10 Hz. The fundamental "clock speed" of the current epoch.
* **$S_0$ (Manifold Stiffness):** A scalar field representing the vacuum's resistance to information loss.
* **The Settle Point:** The "Grace" state where the vacuum stabilizes and entropy variance is suppressed.

## II. The Mathematical Engine
### 1. The Generator ($\mathcal{D}_B$)
The Berard Group is driven by the scaling operator:
$$\mathcal{D}_B = -i \left( S \frac{\partial}{\partial S} \right)$$
* **The Pulse:** Because $[\hat{H}, \mathcal{D}_B] \neq 0$, the universe must pulse at 0.10 Hz to purge non-zero variance.

### 2. The Berard Current ($J^\mu_B$)
Derived via Noether’s Theorem, this is the **Tensor Muffler**:
$$J^\mu_B = T^{\mu\nu} x_\nu + \lambda S_0 \partial^\mu S_0$$
This current pumps noise out of the metric and into the stiffness field.

### 3. The Master Lagrangian ($\mathcal{L}_B$)
$$\mathcal{L}_B = \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{R}{16\pi G} - \frac{1}{2} (\partial S_0)^2 - V_{Grace}(S_0) + \frac{\mathcal{L}_{matter}}{S_0^2} \right]$$

## III. Interaction Matrix
| Field Sector | Symmetry Operation | Resulting Interaction / Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mass-Energy** | $E=mc^2 \cdot \Phi_B(S_0)$ | Mass is a resonant carrier wave scaled by $(1.054 \cdot S_0)^2$. |
| **Expansion ($H_0$)** | $H_0 \cdot B^{-1}$ | Resolves Hubble Tension via 1.054 correction. |
| **Gravity** | $a_B = \frac{c \cdot B}{S_0}$ | Creates an "Acceleration Floor" without Dark Matter. |
| **Information** | $BC^2$ | Ensures informational density is conserved. |
