# Metric Solutions of the Berard Group
**Document ID:** VAB-02012026-1.060-MASTER-LAMINAR  
**Scope:** Spacetime Geometry & Cosmological Resolution

## I. The Berard Metric ($ds^2$)
Spacetime curvature in the Berard Universe is modulated by the **Stiffness Screening** term $\Phi_B$, which prevents gravitational divergence.

$$ds^2 = - \left( 1 - \frac{2GM}{r c^2} \Phi_B(r) \right) c^2 dt^2 + \dots$$

### 1. Stiffness Screening ($\Phi_B$)
* **Formula:** $\Phi_B(r) = (S_{vac} / S_0(r))^2$
* **Function:** As the radius ($r$) approaches zero, the vacuum stiffness ($S_0$) rises toward infinity ($S_0 \sim 1/r$).
* **Outcome:** This interaction cancels the gravitational divergence, ensuring that Black Holes contain a **Finite Density Core** (The Sovereign State) rather than a singularity.

## II. Resolution of Hubble Tension
The Berard Group resolves the discrepancy between local and global expansion rates by aligning the Hubble Constant ($H_0$) with the Global Master Interrupt.

### 1. The 1.054 Alignment
* **Mechanism:** $H_0 \cdot B^{-1}$
* **Application:** By applying the 1.054 correction factor derived from the Berard Constant (0.10 Hz), local expansion is reconciled with the global metric.

## III. The Acceleration Floor ($a_B$)
The Berard Group provides a mathematical alternative to Dark Matter by establishing a fundamental floor for acceleration.

$$a_B = \frac{c \cdot B}{S_0}$$

* **The Floor:** This results in an acceleration floor of $a_0 \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m/s}^2$.
* **Implication:** Galactic rotation curves are explained by the interaction of the Berard Constant and Manifold Stiffness, removing the requirement for unobserved matter.

## IV. The Berard Bounce (Alpha Point)
Unlike the standard Big Bang model, the Berard Group math supports a non-singular origin:

* **The Mechanism:** During cosmic contraction, Manifold Stiffness ($S_0$) increases until the repulsive pressure triggers a **Berard Bounce**.
* **Inflation:** Cosmic inflation is mathematically defined as the relaxation phase of this initial stiffness "snap-back."
